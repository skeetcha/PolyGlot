Were you born with the ability to only see text? How tragic. I can't really describe what the logo looks like with just words. Not English words, anyhow. If only there were a tool to help me make some new ones..."></p>

<p>PolyGlot is a tool that is designed to help in the design, creation, and publication of constructed languages, or conlangs. When I first got into language creation, I realized that there were no tools available that really met all of my needs. So I made one! Below, you'll find a list of its features, and if there's functionality you would like to see added, please feel free to <a href="https://github.com/DraqueT/PolyGlot/issues/new">request a new feature!</a> PolyGlot is free and open source software that contains no advertising or other gross stuff. Please enjoy!</p>

<h3>
<a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>A lexicon with advanced search, classification, and word creation capabilities</li>
<li>user definable orthography, with automatic  generation of word pronunciations</li>
<li>Support for lexicon imports from Excel sheets and CSV files</li>
<li>Formatted publishing to PDF, generating dictionaries (both conlang to natural language, and vice versa), chapter format for all grammar sections, gloss keys, orthographic rules, etc.</li>
<li>Support for importing and embedding custom fonts (useful for languages with nonstandard or custom character sets)</li>
<li>User definable parts of speech with integrated glossing system</li>
<li>User definable rules for declension/conjugation, which automatically generate all legal forms of words</li>
<li>Full logographic engine for languages that incorporate abstract symbols or entirely ideographic writing systems</li>
<li>Fully formatable grammar section, allowing language rules to be elegantly broken into chapters</li>
<li>Recording and playback of spoken examples within the grammar section</li>
<li>Interactive IPA chart with spoken examples and characters copied to clipboard (courtesy of <a href="http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/">http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/</a>)</li>

</ul>

<a id="future-development" class="anchor" href="#future-development" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Future Development</h3>

<p>I plan on continuing to develop and refine PolyGlot so long as there's a healthy conlanging community and people who seem to be enjoying the program. Please feel free to suggest changes/enhancements, request new features, or just drop me a line to show off what you've created with the tool! </p>
